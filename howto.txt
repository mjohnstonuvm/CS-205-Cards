SET-UP:


Choose one player to be the dealer. The oldest player can be the scorekeeper. 
The scorekeeper will record each player’s score at the end of each round of play. 
Shuffle the deck. The player to the left of the dealer cuts the cards. 
The dealer then deals four cards, one at a time and face down, to each player. 
The remaining cards are placed face down, in the middle of the table, as the draw 
pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned over to start the discard pile. 
If that card is a Power card, it is placed back in the deck and another card 
is turned over. Without looking at his cards, each player places his four 
cards face down in a line on the table in front of him. 


GAME-PLAY:


During the game, players will always have their four cards face down on the
table. To begin the game, players peek at their two outer cards once, then
turn them face down again. Each player now knows the point values of two of
his four cards and needs to remember them during the game.
If either of the outer cards are Power cards, the player keeps them, but they
do not have their powers (described below). Power cards only have their
powers when they are drawn from the top of the draw pile.
The player to the left of the dealer has the first turn, and play continues in a
clockwise direction.
